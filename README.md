This project examined weather-station data from outposts in Hawaii. I used Flask to create a tiny website and then used a couple of different techniques to turn the query returns into JSON files. I used <dumps> for some and jsonify for others. SQLAlchemy features prominently, as well. Querying the dataset returns seperate sets of observations for each station and time/date tags tell us the story of how the weather is playing out over those geographic and temporal locations. 

Hawaii sounds like a wonderful place. The temps are remakably similar year-round with only mild variation toward the second and third quarter. And the precipitation (which also has no strict patterns beyond "it happens a lot"), in that warm weather, still sounds gentle and appealing. The most active station is the one at the top of the "desc" filter is station 'USC00519281' with a total of 2772 measurements. There are obly nine stations, which seems like a paucity of stations for such a wide-spread collection footprint.
